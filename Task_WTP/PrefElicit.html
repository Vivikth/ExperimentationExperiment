    In this stage of the experiment, we want to determine how much you value each meal. <br>
    We will use the switch-point procedure to determine how much you value each meal based on its description. <br>
    We have put information about the switch-point procedure at the bottom of the page if you'd like to refer back to it. <br>
</p>
<br>

<h4> How much do you value eating <b>{{Task_name}}</b>?</h4>
<p>
    The description is: <strong> {{Task_description}}</strong>.  <br>
    The allergen information is: <strong> {{Allergen_information}}</strong>. <br>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Option A</b> means you eat {{Meal_number}} at the third session on {{player.participant.sample_meal_day}} the
    {{player.participant.sample_meal_date}}, and complete the rest of this session. <br>
    <b>Option B</b> means you get the money at the third session on {{player.participant.next_meal_day}} the
    {{player.participant.sample_meal_date}}, and complete the rest of this session.
</p>
<p>
    We will ask you the following questions. <br>
    Note: There is a <b>20%</b> chance that one of the questions in this stage will be selected.

<br>
<p>
    To save time, we will just ask you for your <b>switch-point</b>: the monetary amount at which you would switch from option A to option B. <br>
    Please enter your answer as a number (i.e a number between 0.00 and 20.00). <br>
