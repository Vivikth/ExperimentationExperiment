<p>
    In this stage of the experiment, you will choose a sample to eat at the second session on {{player.participant.sample_meal_day}}
    the {{player.participant.sample_meal_date}} and a menu for the third session on
    {{player.participant.next_meal_day}} the {{player.participant.next_meal_date}}. <br>
    Instead of selecting meals directly, you will have to choose a <b>sample-menu pair</b>. <br>
</p>

<h4>What is a sample-menu pair?</h4>
<p>
    A sample-menu pair consists of a single sample, and a list of meals. <br>
    To complete a sample-menu pair, you must first eat the single sample at the second session. <br>
    After eating the single sample, you will be able to choose a meal from the list at the third session and eat that meal
    at the third session. <br>
</p>

<h4>What you need to do</h4>

<p>
    You will need to choose 2 sample-menu pairs. <br>
    I will randomly select one sample-menu pair for you to complete.
</p>
<br>


<p>
    Remember, the choices you make now will <b>affect</b> the meal you eat at the third session, and the sample you eat
    at the second session.<br>
    Click the next button to choose your sample-menu pairs. <br>
