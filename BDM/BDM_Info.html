<p>In this experiment, we wish to determine how much you value an item. <br>
    We will use a procedure called the switch-point procedure for this purpose. <br>
    In the switch-point procedure we provide you with two options, and ask when you'd switch from choosing one option to the next. <br>
    The procedure is explained below.
    <br>

<h3>The switch-point procedure</h3>
<p>
    Let's suppose that we want to determine how much Tim values a pencil. <br>
    Here are the steps we wouldd take. <br>
</p>

<h5>Step 1: Give Tim a list of questions</h5>
<p>
    We provide Tim with a list of questions like the ones in the table below. <br>
    Each row in the table (apart from the header row) shows a question that we can ask Tim. <br>
    In each question, Tim picks either option A (the pencil) or option B (the money). <br>
</p>

<br>
<h5>Step 2: Tell Tim there is a 20% chance that a question will be randomly selected</h5>
<p>
    All questions are equally likely to be selected, but there is only a 20% chance that one question will be selected (and a 80% chance that no question is selected). <br>
    If a question is selected, we will give Tim the option he chose on that question. <br>
    Tim has no reason to lie on any question, because if that  question gets selected then Tim would end up with the option he likes less.</p>
<h5>Step 3: Ask Tim for his switch-point </h5>
<p>
    A reasonable assumption is that Tim prefers option A for the first few questions, but at some point will switch to choosing option B. <br>
    So, to save time, we can just ask Tim for his <b>switch-point</b>: the monetary value at which he'd switch from choosing option A to option B. <br>
    Once Tim has stated his switch-point, we can ‘fill out’ Tim's answers to all 2001 questions based on his switch point (choosing Option A for all questions before his switch point, and Option B for all questions at or after his switch point). <br>
    Tim still has no reason to lie as he might end up with an option he likes less.
</p>
<h5>Step 4: (Potentially) pick a question at random </h5>
<p>
    If we randomly select a question, we will give Tim the option he picked on that question (determined from his switch-point). <br>
    For instance, if question 1001 is randomly selected (which corresponds to $10.00), and Tim said he preferred the pencil on that question, I would give Tim the pencil.
</p>
That's all there is to the monetary switch-point procedure!

<h5> An Example</h5>
<p>
    Suppose Luke's true switch point is $2. <br>
    If offered less than $2, Luke would prefer the pencil. <br>
    Likewise, if offered Luke more than $2, he would prefer to take the money over the pencil. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Now, let's suppose Luke lies and states that his switch point is $3.
    Let's suppose that question 251 (which corresponds to $2.50) was randomly selected.
    Since Luke has said his switch-point is $3, we would give him the pencil instead of the money.
    However, Luke would prefer the money to the pencil.
    So, if Luke lies about his switch-point he may receive an outcome he prefers less!
</p>

<h2> Summary</h2>
<p>
    The switch-point procedure is a way that we can determine your valuation for a task or an item. <br>
    Your switch point is the monetary value that causes you to switch from option A to option B. <br>
    You have no reason to lie about your switch-point, because lying might leave you with an outcome that you prefer less. <br>
