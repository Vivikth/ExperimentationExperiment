<h4> Video Description of experiment goes here</h4>
<br>

<p>
    You are about to participate in an experiment on the economics of decision-making. <br>
    If you <b>complete</b> this experiment, you will earn <b>${{ C.PAYMENT_AMOUNT }}</b>, which will be paid to you via PayPal at the end of the experiment. <br>
    We will also provide you with a sample of food at this session, and dinner later tonight. <br>
    On average, I expect that the current session of the experiment will take approximately <b>X</b> minutes. <br>
</p>
<br>
<h3> The Basic Idea </h3>
<p>
    This experiment has 2 sessions: the current session, and a dinner session at <b>TIME</b> tonight. <br>
    All the choices you make in this experiment will determine the food you are served at the current session and the dinner session -
    so <i>choosing appropriately</i> will allow you to eat the foods you <b>prefer</b>. <br>
    You can click the text below to see the descriptions of each food.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>
    The current session has 3 stages. <br>
    First, I will ask you some questions about how much you value the different foods. <br>
    Afterwards, you will choose a sample for this session and a dinner menu from a specified list. <br>
    Finally, you will answer a simple demographic survey at the end of the session, then get to try a food sample. <br>
</p>
<p>
    At the dinner session, you will be able to select foods from the menu you chose in this session. <br>
    You will need to fill out a small survey during the dinner session. <br>
    Please note that you will only be paid if you <b>complete</b> the demographic survey and the survey at the dinner session.
</p>


<h3>Quick Questions</h3>

    Before moving on, please answer the following questions.

<h4>The next stage</h4>
<p> As part of this experiment, I want to determine how much you value a food. <br>
    I will use a procedure called the switch-point procedure for this purpose. <br>
