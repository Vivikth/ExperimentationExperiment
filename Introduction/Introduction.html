<h4> Video Description of experiment goes here</h4>
<br>

<p>
    You are about to participate in an experiment on the economics of decision-making. <br>
    The experiment consists of three sessions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> The current session </li>
    <li> A second session at {{player.participant.sample_meal_time}}-time on {{player.participant.sample_meal_day}}
    the {{player.participant.sample_meal_date}} </li>
    <li> A third session at {{player.participant.next_meal_time}}-time on
 {{player.participant.next_meal_day}} the {{player.participant.next_meal_date}}</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    If you <b>complete</b> this experiment, you will earn a <b>minimum</b> of <b>${{ C.PAYMENT_AMOUNT }}</b>, which will be paid to you in cash at the second session. <br>
    Depending on the choices you make in the experiment, you will receive one of the following:
<ul>
    <li> A sample at the second session and a full meal at the third session OR</li>
    <li> A full meal at the second session OR </li>
    <li> Additional cash at the second session </li>
</ul>
    On average, I expect that the current session of the experiment will take approximately <b>X</b> minutes. <br>
</p>
<br>
<h3> The Basic Idea </h3>
<p>
    All the choices you make in this experiment will determine the meals you are served at the second session and third sessions -
    so <i>choosing appropriately</i> will allow you to eat the foods you <b>prefer</b>. <br>
    You can click the text below to see the descriptions of each meal.
</p>

<details>
    <summary> Click this text to show / hide the descriptions of the foods available</summary>
    {{ include 'Choice/Food_Descriptions.html'}}
</details>

<br>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>
    The current session has 3 stages. <br>
    First, I will ask you some questions about how much you value the different meals. <br>
    Afterwards, you will choose a lunch sample for the second session and a
    {{player.participant.next_meal_time}} menu for the third session from a specified list. <br>
    Finally, you will answer a simple demographic survey at the end of the session. <br>
</p>
<p>
    At the second session, you will be able to try your chosen lunch sample or meal.
    At the third session, you will be able to choose a meal from the {{player.participant.next_meal_time}} menu you
    chose in this session. <br>
    Please note that you will only be paid if you <b>complete</b> the demographic survey at the end of this session.
</p>

<h3>Quick Questions</h3>
<p>
    Before moving on, please answer the following questions.
</p>

    <label>   How much will you be paid if you <b>complete</b> the demographic survey?</label>
<div>
    <label>$</label>
    <input name="payment_question">
</div>
{{ formfield_errors 'payment_question' }}

<br>



{{ formfield 'Tried_Fancy_Pizza'  }}
{{ formfield 'Tried_Cheap_Pizza'  }}
{{ formfield 'Tried_Fancy_Taco'  }}
{{ formfield 'Tried_Cheap_Taco'  }}



<h4>The next stage</h4>
<p> As part of this experiment, I want to determine how much you value each meal. <br>
    I will use a procedure called the switch-point procedure for this purpose. <br>
    Click the next button to learn about the switch-point procedure.
