Here are the results from your switch-point procedure.

    {{ if player.participant.rand_outcome == "No_BDM" }}
<p>
    None of the switch-point questions were selected. <br>
</p>
    {{ endif }}

    {{ if player.participant.rand_outcome == "Yes_BDM" }}
<p>
    One of the switch-point questions was selected. <br>
    I randomly selected {{player.participant.rand_task}} as the meal. <br>
    I randomly selected question number {{player.participant.BDM_Num}} as the question, which corresponds to ${{BDM_Payout|to2}}. <br>
    Your switch-point for this task was ${{ player.participant.switch_point|to2 }}. <br>
</p>
<br>
        {{if player.participant.switch_point > player.participant.BDM_Num}}
    <p>
        Your switch-point was higher than the selected question. <br>
        This means you said that you prefer eating {{player.participant.rand_task}} to the money. <br>
        You will be able to eat {{player.participant.rand_task}} at the second session.
    </p>
        {{endif}}

        {{if player.participant.BDM_Num >= player.participant.switch_point }}
    <p>
        Your switch-point was lower than the selected question. <br>
        This means you said that you prefer the money to eating {{player.participant.rand_task}}. <br>
        You will receive the money at the end of this session.
    </p>
        {{endif}}
